# Icon Files

The extension requires icon files at:
- `public/icons/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `public/icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `public/icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using:
1. Online tools like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
3. AI image generators

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use a microphone or podcast-related icon
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use the gradient colors: #667eea to #764ba2 (matching the UI)

## Quick Solution

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome may show warnings.
